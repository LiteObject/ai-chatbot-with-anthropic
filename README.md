Anthropic's Claude 3 models are a family of three AI assistants that can help with tasks across organizations. The models are optimized for different enterprise applications, including:

## Claude 3 Opus: 
Anthropic's most capable model, with improved accuracy compared to Claude 2.1

## Claude 3 Sonnet: 
A combination of skills and speed, good for data processing and sales tasks

## Claude 3 Haiku: 
The fastest and most compact model

## Key features
- Multilingual capabilities: Claude 3 models offer improved fluency in non-English languages such as Spanish and Japanese, enabling use cases like translation services and global content creation.
- Vision and image processing: All Claude 3 models can process and analyze visual input, extracting insights from documents, processing web UI, generating image catalog metadata, and more. See our vision page to learn more.
- Steerability and ease of use: Claude 3 models are easier to steer and better at following directions. This gives you more control over model behavior and and more predictable, higher-quality outputs.
- Model upgrades: The Claude 3 family will periodically receive updates to enhance performance, expand capabilities, and address any identified issues. However, each update will be pinned to a new model version, guaranteeing that your workflows on one model version will not break with the release of a new version. When a new model version is released, we will provide a transition period to allow developers to update their applications.
